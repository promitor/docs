You can declare to scrape an Azure CDN via the `Cdn` resource
type.

When using declared resources, the following fields need to be provided:

- `cdnName` - The name of the Azure CDN resource

All supported metrics are documented in the official [Azure Monitor documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported#microsoftcdnprofiles).

> ðŸš¨ The availability of metrics depends on the SKU of the Azure CDN resource.

## Example

Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
name: azure_cdn_requests
description: "Amount of requests sent to Azure CDN"
resourceType: Cdn
azureMetricConfiguration:
  metricName: RequestCount
  aggregation:
    type: Total
resources: # Optional, required when no resource discovery is configured
- cdnName: promitor-cdn-1
- cdnName: promitor-cdn-2
resourceDiscoveryGroups: # Optional, requires Promitor Resource Discovery agent (https://docs.promitor.io/latest/how-it-works#using-resource-discovery)
- name: cdn-landscape
```
