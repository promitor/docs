How does Promitor handle deleted resources? Is scraping multiple subscriptions supported? What Azure clouds are supported? Why does Azure Blob & File Storage only report account-level information? Why does my multi-dimensional metric report label value unknown with Prometheus? What operating systems are supported? Are multi-dimensional metrics supported? \u00b6 Yes, every scraper supports scraping multi-dimensional metrics except for Azure Storage queues. You can configure the dimension you are interested in via azureMetricConfiguration.dimension.Name , for more information see our 'Metric Configuration' page . However, you can only use it with metrics in Azure Monitor that support this, for a complete overview we recommend reading the official documentation . How does Promitor handle deleted resources? \u00b6 The approach depends if you are using declarative metrics or resource discovery but we highly recommend to enable Prometheus metric timestamps in our runtime configuration to indicate how old the metric is. When using declarative metrics \u00b6 Promitor will scrape all resources that are configured and report the metrics accordingly. If that resource is deleted, we will still serve the metrics as long as we can until it is no longer available and exceptions will be thrown . We recommend to update the metrics declaration when a resource is deleted to avoid polluting logs. When using resource discovery \u00b6 Promitor will automatically discover all matching resources which means that it will automatically scrape metrics for new/removed resources . Removed resources will immediately stop being scraped by Promitor, but still be reported in Prometheus scrape endpoint. Is scraping multiple subscriptions supported? \u00b6 No, we do not support scraping multiple subscriptions as of today as we consider that to be a security boundary. However, you can deploy multiple instances of Promitor that each scrape another subscription. We have it on our backlog to see if there is enough demand for it, feel free to give a . If that is the case, we will reconsider this limitation. What Azure clouds are supported? \u00b6 We support Global (default), China , UsGov & Germany Azure clouds. This can be configured in the metric configuration under azureMetadata . For more information see our 'Metric Configuration' page . Why does Azure Blob & File Storage only report account-level information? \u00b6 Azure Monitor currently only provides account-level metrics which we can serve. As part of #450 & #446 we plan to provide the capability to have more granular information. Why does my multi-dimensional metric report label value unknown with Prometheus? \u00b6 When Promitor is unable to find a metric for a multi-dimensional metric, it will report unknown for the dimension label given it was not able to determine what the dimension value is due to the lack of metrics. You can read more about it in our Prometheus sink documentation . What operating systems are supported? \u00b6 We support running on both Linux & Windows platforms.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions-faqs","text":"Here are a list of questions you may have: Are multi-dimensional metrics supported?

Scraping Azure Monitor metrics \u00b6 When you want to scrape resources, you can use Promitor Scraper which uses a metrics-as-code approach. By writing a metric declaration, you will define what Azure Monitor metrics to scrape for a set of Azure resources and to what metric sink(s) they should be reported. Here's an overview of how it works: Using resource discovery \u00b6 While Promitor Scraper uses a declarative approach for defining Azure resources to scrape; as of Promitor Scraper 2.0 you can integrate with Promitor Resource Discovery ! With resource discovery, you can define resource discovery groups that represent Azure resources of a given type and optionally define criteria for the resources to comply with. By doing this, you can change your metric declaration for Promitor Scraper so that, instead of using declared resources, reference a resource discovery group which be used to determine what Azure resources it should scrape metrics for. Behind the scenes, Promitor Resource Discovery integrates with Azure Resource Graph which will query your Azure landscape to discover the corresponding resources. Here's an overview of how they work together: You can easily start discovering resources automatically: Declare resource discovery groups ( link ) Deploy Promitor Resource Discovery ( link ) Configure Promitor Scraper to use resource discovery ( link ) Deploy Promitor Scraper ( link ) What components do agents provide? \u00b6 Every Promitor agent provides a REST API which which you can integrate and uses background jobs to acquire the data to reduce latency.

Promitor Resource Discovery runtime is configured by mounting the configuration to a volume. Depending on the operating system, it need to be available on : /config/runtime.yaml for Linux c:/config/runtime.yaml for Windows We provide the capability to override te runtime YAML via environment variables , if you have the need for it. Here is a complete example of the runtime YAML: authentication : # Options are ServicePrincipal, SystemAssignedManagedIdentity, UserAssignedManagedIdentity. mode : ServicePrincipal # Optional. Default: ServicePrincipal. identityId : xxxx-xxxx-xxxx # Optional. server : httpPort : 80 # Optional. Default: 80 cache : enabled : true # Optional. Default: true durationInMinutes : 5 # Optional. Default: 5 telemetry : applicationInsights : instrumentationKey : ABC # Optional. Note: Required to be specified when turned on isEnabled : false # Optional. Default: false verbosity : trace # Optional. Default: N/A containerLogs : isEnabled : true # Optional. Default: true verbosity : trace # Optional. Default: N/A defaultVerbosity : error # Optional. Default: error Authentication \u00b6 The Promitor runtime allows you to use various ways to authenticate to Azure: authentication.mode - Defines authentication mode to use. Options are ServicePrincipal , SystemAssignedManagedIdentity , UserAssignedManagedIdentity . (defaults to service principle) authentication.identityId - Id of the Azure AD entity to authenticate with when integrating with Microsoft Azure. Required when using ServicePrincipal or UserAssignedManagedIdentity . Example: authentication : # Options are ServicePrincipal, SystemAssignedManagedIdentity, UserAssignedManagedIdentity. mode : ServicePrincipal # Optional. Default: ServicePrincipal. identityId : xxxx-xxxx-xxxx # Optional. Runtime \u00b6 The Promitor runtime is flexible and allows you to configure it to meet your needs: server.httpPort - Defines the port to serve HTTP traffic (default 80) Example: server : httpPort : 80 # Optional. Default: 80 Cache \u00b6 The Promitor runtime allows you to cache discovered resources to optimize for performance and avoid hitting Azure throttling. You can configure how the cache should behave: cache.enabled - Indication whether or not discovered resources should be cached in-memory. (default true) cache.durationInMinutes - Amount of minutes to cache discovered resources. (default 5) Example: cache : enabled : true # Optional. Default: true durationInMinutes : 5 # Optional. Default: 5 Telemetry \u00b6 We provide insights in how our runtime is doing and is written to one or more sinks. You can determine what telemetry sinks you want and what the default verbosity should be via the runtime YAML. General telemetry information can be configured: telemetry.defaultVerbosity - Defines the default minimum log level that should be logged if a sink does not provide one. Allowed values are Trace , Debug , Information , Warning , Error , Critical , None ordered from most to least verbose. (Default: Error ) To learn more about the configured sinks and their configuration, see \"Telemetry Sinks\" . Example: telemetry : applicationInsights : # [...] containerLogs : # [...] defaultVerbosity : error # Optional. Default: error Telemetry Sinks \u00b6 Promitor provides the telemetry, but it's up to you to choose where you want to send it to. We currently support the following sinks: Container Logs (stdout/stderr) Azure Application Insights Container Logs \u00b6 Promitor can send telemetry to stdout / stderr . In order to enable use this sink, the following configuration needs to be provided: telemetry.containerLogs.isEnabled - Determines if the sink is used or not. (Default: true ) telemetry.containerLogs.verbosity - Verbosity to use for this sink, if not specified then the telemetry.defaultVerbosity will be used. (Optional) Example: telemetry : containerLogs : isEnabled : true # Optional. Default: true verbosity : trace # Optional. Default: N/A defaultVerbosity : error # Optional. Default: error Azure Application Insights \u00b6 Promitor can send telemetry to Azure Application Insights when there is a need to. It currently supports: Traces Exceptions In order to enable use this sink, the following configuration needs to be provided: telemetry.applicationInsights.isEnabled - Determines if the sink is used or not. (Default: true ) telemetry.applicationInsights.verbosity - Verbosity to use for this sink, if not specified then the telemetry.defaultVerbosity will be used. (Optional) telemetry.applicationInsights.instrumentationKey - Defines the instrumentation key to use when sending telemetry to Azure Application Insights Example: telemetry : applicationInsights : instrumentationKey : ABC # Optional. Note: Required to be specified when turned on isEnabled : false # Optional. Default: false verbosity : trace # Optional. Default: N/A containerLogs : isEnabled : true # Optional. Default: true verbosity : trace # Optional. Default: N/A defaultVerbosity : error # Optional. Default: error Overriding configuration with environment variables \u00b6 In certain scenarios you'd like to override what was configured in the runtime YAML. Therefore we provide the capability to override them via environment variables. Every environment variable should be prefixed with PROMITOR_YAML_OVERRIDE_ followed by the YAML hierarchy where every level is replaced with __ rather than a tab.

Indication whether or not resource discovery is enabled through the Promitor Resource Discovery agent. port : 88 # Optional. Port of Promitor Resource Discovery agent Note: Using Promitor v0.x? Use environment variables to configure the runtime. Authentication \u00b6 The Promitor runtime allows you to use various ways to authenticate to Azure: authentication.mode - Defines authentication mode to use. Options are ServicePrincipal , SystemAssignedManagedIdentity , UserAssignedManagedIdentity . (defaults to service principle) authentication.identityId - Id of the Azure AD entity to authenticate with when integrating with Microsoft Azure. Required when using ServicePrincipal or UserAssignedManagedIdentity . Example: authentication : # Options are ServicePrincipal, SystemAssignedManagedIdentity, UserAssignedManagedIdentity. mode : ServicePrincipal # Optional. Default: ServicePrincipal. identityId : xxxx-xxxx-xxxx # Optional. Runtime \u00b6 The Promitor runtime is flexible and allows you to configure it to meet your needs: server.httpPort - Defines the port to serve HTTP traffic (default 80) Example: server : httpPort : 80 # Optional. Default: 80 Metric Sinks \u00b6 Promitor automatically scrapes Azure Monitor and makes the information available by providing the metric information to the configured sinks. As of today, we support the follow sinks: Atlassian Statuspage Prometheus Scraping Endpoint StatsD Atlassian Statuspage \u00b6 In order to expose an Atlassian Statuspage endpoint, you'll need to configure the sink: atlassianStatuspage.pageId - Defines the id of the Atlassian Statuspage to report to. atlassianStatuspage.systemMetricMapping - Defines a mapping of the scraped metric by Promitor and to which Atlassian Statuspage system metric it should be reported to. Here's what we expect: id - Id of the Atlassian Statuspage system metric promitorMetricName - Name of the Promitor metric which needs to be reported Next to that, PROMITOR_ATLASSIAN_STATUSPAGE_APIKEY environment variable is required which contains the API Key for Atlassian Statuspage. metricSinks : atlassianStatuspage : pageId : XXX # Mandatory systemMetricMapping : # Mandatory to have at least one mapping - id : ABC promitorMetricName : promitor_demo_appplan_percentage_cpu As of today, metric labels, resource discovery and multi-resource scraping are not supported. This is because Promitor will report the different resource metrics to the same Atlassian metric which will mix metrics which becomes confusing. Prometheus Scraping Endpoint \u00b6 In order to expose a Prometheus Scraping endpoint, you'll need to configure the sink: prometheusScrapingEndpoint.metricUnavailableValue - Defines the value that will be reported if a metric is unavailable. (Default: NaN ) prometheusScrapingEndpoint.enableMetricTimestamps - Defines whether or not a timestamp should be included when the value was scraped on Azure Monitor. Supported values are True to opt-in & False to opt-out. (Default: true ) prometheusScrapingEndpoint.baseUriPath - Controls the path where the scraping endpoint for Prometheus is being exposed. (Default: /metrics ) prometheusScrapingEndpoint.labels.transformation - Controls how label values are reported to Prometheus by using transformation. Options are None & Lowercase . (Default: None ) metricSinks : prometheusScrapingEndpoint : metricUnavailableValue : NaN # Optional. Default: NaN enableMetricTimestamps : false # Optional. Default: true baseUriPath : /metrics # Optional. Default: /metrics labels : transformation : None # Optional. Default: None. What happens when metrics are unavailable for multi-dimensional metrics? \u00b6 Promitor allows you to use dimension in metrics so that it will report all values. For example, when scraping an Azure Event Hub namespace you can report the same metric for every entity inside the namespace. When Promitor reports the metric it will always add a label which clarifies the subresource. However; when it cannot find a metric for that dimension it will keep on reporting the metric, but with value unknown given it cannot determine the name of the dimension. StatsD \u00b6 In order to push metrics to a StatsD server, you'll need to configure the sink: metricSinks.statsd.host - DNS name or IP address of StatsD server. metricSinks.statsd.host - Port (UDP) address of StatsD server. (Default: 8125 ) metricSinks.statsd.metricPrefix - Prefix that will be added to every metric defined in the metric declaration. metricSinks : statsd : host : graphite port : 8125 metricPrefix : promitor. As of today, metric labels are not supported. Unfortunately, this is not supported in the specification. Using resource discovery \u00b6 Resource discovery can be used by integrating with Promitor Resource Discovery which allows you to scrape metrics by using discovery groups. In order to enable this, resource discovery must be configured first: resourceDiscovery.enabled - Indication whether or not resource discovery is enabled through the Promitor Resource Discovery agent. resourceDiscovery.host - DNS name of Promitor Resource Discovery agent. resourceDiscovery.port - Port of Promitor Resource Discovery agent. resourceDiscovery : host : promitor.agents.resourcediscovery enabled : true port : 88 # Optional. Default: 80 To learn more about how Promitor Scraper and Promitor Resource Discovery work together, read our documentation . Metric Configuration \u00b6 Promitor will scrape the Azure Monitor metrics that are configured via a metric declaration YAML. The behavior of this is configurable: metricsConfiguration.absolutePath - Defines the location of the YAML file that declares what Azure Monitor metrics to scrape. (Default: /config/metrics-declaration.yaml ) Example: metricsConfiguration : absolutePath : /config/metrics-declaration.yaml # Optional. Default: /config/metrics-declaration.yaml Telemetry \u00b6 We provide insights in how our runtime is doing and is written to one or more sinks. You can determine what telemetry sinks you want and what the default verbosity should be via the runtime YAML. General telemetry information can be configured: telemetry.defaultVerbosity - Defines the default minimum log level that should be logged if a sink does not provide one. Allowed values are Trace , Debug , Information , Warning , Error , Critical , None ordered from most to least verbose. (Default: Error ) To learn more about the configured sinks and their configuration, see \"Telemetry Sinks\" . Example: telemetry : applicationInsights : # [...] containerLogs : # [...] defaultVerbosity : error # Optional. Default: error Telemetry Sinks \u00b6 Promitor provides the telemetry, but it's up to you to choose where you want to send it to. We currently support the following sinks: Container Logs (stdout/stderr) Azure Application Insights Container Logs \u00b6 Promitor can send telemetry to stdout / stderr . In order to enable use this sink, the following configuration needs to be provided: telemetry.containerLogs.isEnabled - Determines if the sink is used or not. (Default: true ) telemetry.containerLogs.verbosity - Verbosity to use for this sink, if not specified then the telemetry.defaultVerbosity will be used. (Optional) Example: telemetry : containerLogs : isEnabled : true # Optional. Default: true verbosity : trace # Optional. Default: N/A defaultVerbosity : error # Optional. Default: error Azure Application Insights \u00b6 Promitor can send telemetry to Azure Application Insights when there is a need to. It currently supports: Traces Exceptions In order to enable use this sink, the following configuration needs to be provided: telemetry.applicationInsights.isEnabled - Determines if the sink is used or not. (Default: true ) telemetry.applicationInsights.verbosity - Verbosity to use for this sink, if not specified then the telemetry.defaultVerbosity will be used. (Optional) telemetry.applicationInsights.instrumentationKey - Defines the instrumentation key to use when sending telemetry to Azure Application Insights Example: telemetry : applicationInsights : instrumentationKey : ABC # Optional. Note: Required to be specified when turned on isEnabled : false # Optional. Default: false verbosity : trace # Optional. Default: N/A containerLogs : isEnabled : true # Optional. Default: true verbosity : trace # Optional. Default: N/A defaultVerbosity : error # Optional. Default: error Azure Monitor \u00b6 Promitor interacts with Azure Monitor API to scrape all the required metrics. During troubleshooting it can be interesting to gain insights on what the API returns, for which you can opt-in. The behavior of this can be configured to fit your needs: azureMonitor.logging.informationLevel - Defines granularity of information that should be reported. Available options are Basic , Headers , Body & BodyAndHeaders . (Default: Basic ) azureMonitor.logging.isEnabled - Defines whether or not information concerning the integration with Azure Monitor API. (Default: false ) Example: azureMonitor : logging : informationLevel : Basic # Optional. Default: Basic isEnabled : false # Optional. Default: false Note: All telemetry is emitted as trace so you have to make sure telemetry is configured correctly. Overriding configuration with environment variables \u00b6 In certain scenarios you'd like to override what was configured in the runtime YAML. Therefore we provide the capability to override them via environment variables. Every environment variable should be prefixed with PROMITOR_YAML_OVERRIDE_ followed by the YAML hierarchy where every level is replaced with __ rather than a tab. Environment variables are not case sensitive. Our runtime configuration API endpoint allows you to verify if it was overriden and returns what will be used to run Promitor. Depending on the configuration that is changed it may be required to restart Promitor, for example changing the HTTP port. Example \u00b6 Let's say we want to override the following HTTP port: server : httpPort : 80 An environment variable called PROMITOR_YAML_OVERRIDE_server__httpPort can be provided which specifies the new port. \u2190 back","title":"Runtime Configuration"},{"location":"scraping/runtime-configuration/#runtime-configuration","text":"This article covers an overview of all the knobs that you can tweak to align the Scraper runtime with your needs.

In order to have a resource to monitor, we'll create a Service Bus queue and add load to the queue with Service Bus Explorer. We'll deploy Promitor, Prometheus, and Grafana to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm, and explain how each of these services connects and how to see output. We'll also walk through setting up basic Grafana dashboard to visualize the metrics we're monitoring.

It can also be installed via the Azure CLI with az aks install-cli . Helm , a Kubernetes deployment manager Service Bus Explorer Deploy Azure Infrastructure \u00b6 Create a Resource Group \u00b6 az group create --name PromitorRG --location eastus Output: { \"id\" : \"/subscriptions/<guid-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/PromitorRG\" , \"...\" : \"...\" } Create a Service Principal \u00b6 Use the resource group creation output to add a scope to your service principal: az ad sp create-for-rbac \\ --role = \"Monitoring Reader\" \\ --scopes = \"/subscriptions/<guid-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/PromitorRG\" Which should output something similar to { \"appId\" : \"<guid-sp-app-id>\" , \"displayName\" : \"azure-cli-2019-03-29-19-21-58\" , \"name\" : \"http://azure-cli-2019-03-29-19-21-58\" , \"password\" : \"<guid-sp-generated-password>\" , \"tenant\" : \"<guid-tenant-id>\" } Save this output as we will use the app ID, tenant ID, and password later on. Create a Service Bus Namespace and Queue \u00b6 First we'll need to create a namespace. Service Bus Namespaces need to be globally unique, so we won't use a default name in these commands. az servicebus namespace create \\ --resource-group PromitorRG \\ --name <service-bus-namespace> \\ --location eastus We'll then create a queue in that namespace: az servicebus queue create \\ --resource-group PromitorRG \\ --namespace-name <service-bus-namespace> \\ --name demo_queue Finally, get the connection string for this Service Bus namespace for use later. az servicebus namespace authorization-rule keys list \\ --resource-group PromitorRG \\ --namespace-name <service-bus-namespace> \\ --name RootManageSharedAccessKey \\ --query primaryConnectionString \\ --output tsv Create an AKS Cluster \u00b6 Create a cluster with: az aks create \\ --name PromitorCluster \\ --resource-group PromitorRG \\ --node-count 1 \\ --generate-ssh-keys Cluster Setup \u00b6 Get credentials \u00b6 You can get your cluster's credentials with az aks get-credentials \\ --name PromitorCluster \\ --resource-group PromitorRG This will save these credentials to your kubeconfig file and set your new cluster as your current context for all kubectl commands. Verify your credentials and check that your cluster is up and running with kubectl get nodes . Deploy Promitor and Prometheus \u00b6 Create a metrics declaration for Promitor \u00b6 Before deploying Promitor, you'll need a values file with secrets & a metric declaration file (these can also be the same file for ease of use). The yaml below will scrape one metric, queue length, from the queue created above. azureAuthentication : appId : <guid-sp-app-id> appKey : <guid-sp-generated-password> azureMetadata : tenantId : <guid-tenant-id> subscriptionId : <guid-subscription-id> resourceGroupName : PromitorRG metricDefaults : aggregation : interval : 00:05:00 scraping : schedule : \"* * * * *\" metrics : - name : demo_queue_size description : \"Amount of active messages of the 'demo_queue' queue\" resourceType : ServiceBusNamespace azureMetricConfiguration : metricName : ActiveMessages aggregation : type : Total resources : - namespace : <service-bus-namespace> queueName : demo_queue Deploy Promitor to your cluster using Helm \u00b6 To deploy, we'll first add the Promitor chart repository to helm: helm repo add promitor https://charts.promitor.io/ helm repo update With this repository added, we can deploy Promitor: helm install promitor-agent-scraper promitor/promitor-agent-scraper \\ --values your/path/to/metric-declaration.yaml Install Prometheus \u00b6 Note: If you're seeing errors installing Prometheus or Grafana from the Helm chart repository, make sure you run helm repo update before digging into the errors more. You might have an outdated copy of the chart. Running the deployment command from the previous section should give you an output that includes a script similar to this one: cat > promitor-scrape-config.yaml <<EOF extraScrapeConfigs: | - job_name: promitor-agent-scraper metrics_path: /metrics static_configs: - targets: - promitor-agent-scraper.default.svc.cluster.local:80 EOF helm install stable/prometheus -f promitor-scrape-config.yaml You can see this output again at any time by running helm status promitor-agent-scraper . Running these commands will create a Prometheus scraping configuration file in your current directory and deploy Prometheus to your cluster with that scraping configuration in addition to the default. Test and check output \u00b6 Add load to the queue \u00b6 Now we'll use Service Bus Explorer to add load to our Service Bus queue so there are meaningful metrics for Promitor to pick up. In Service Bus Explorer, you can connect to your namespace & queue using a connection string. From there, right clicking on the queue in the side-bar should give you an option to 'Send Message' - from there, use the 'Sender' tab of that window to send bulk messages. Remember how many you send - you should see that number in the Promitor & Prometheus output. See Promitor & Prometheus output via port-forwarding \u00b6 Going back to your cluster, you should be able to see all Promitor & Prometheus pods up and running with kubectl get pods . You can also see the services which provide a stable endpoint at which to reach the pods by running kubectl get services . This should give you a list with output similar to: NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) promitor-agent-scraper ClusterIP 10.0.#.# \\<none> 80/TCP \\<prometheus-release-name>-prometheus-server ClusterIP 10.0.#.# \\<none> 80/TCP Next to that, it should also list other services deployed by Prometheus. Let's first look at the Promitor output! Run kubectl port-forward svc/promitor-agent-scraper 8080:80 and check http://localhost:8080/metrics . You should see some information about your queue: # HELP promitor_ratelimit_arm Indication how many calls are still available before Azure Resource Manager is going to throttle us. # TYPE promitor_ratelimit_arm gauge promitor_ratelimit_arm { tenant_id = <guid-tenant-id>,subscription_id = <guid-subscription-id>,app_id = <guid-sp-app-id> } 11998 1558116465529 # HELP demo_queue_size Amount of active messages of the 'demo_queue' queue # TYPE demo_queue_size gauge demo_queue_size 200 1558116465677 where 200 is the number of messages sent. We can also look at the Prometheus server and check that it's pulling in metrics from Promitor. Cancel the previous port-forward command and run kubectl port-forward svc/<prometheus-release-name>-prometheus-server 8080:80 . Now, if you check http://localhost:8080 , you should be able to enter Prometheus queries. Query demo_queue_size and as long as all your pods are up and running and both Promitor and Prometheus have scraped metrics at least once, you should see a value that matches the number of messages in your queue. Visualization \u00b6 Install Grafana \u00b6 Grafana's chart has a few default values you may not want long term - persistant storage is disabled and admin username/password is randomly generated - but for our sample the out-of-the-box install will work. Run helm install grafana stable/grafana and you should see output that includes this command: kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath = \"{.data.admin-password}\" | base64 --decode ; echo Run this to get your Grafana password. Now you can use kubectl port-forward again to log in to your Grafana dashboard. kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 8080:80 will make your dashboard available at http://localhost:8080 , and you can log in with username 'admin' and the password you retrieved. Add Prometheus as a data source \u00b6 After logging in, you should see an option to \"Add a Data Source.\" Click that, and choose the Prometheus source type (if it's not immediately visible, search for it). The only setting you should need to edit here is the URL, under the HTTP section. Within your cluster, http://<prometheus-release-name>-prometheus-server.default.svc.cluster.local should resolve to the Prometheus server service. (Default in that URL refers to the namespace - if you installed in a namespace other than default, change that.) Set your service's name as the Prometheus URL in Grafana, and save the data source. It should tell you that the data source is working. Create a Grafana dashboard for queue metrics \u00b6 First, we'll make a basic dashboard with the metric we set up in Promitor. Then you can use a pre-built dashboard to show Prometheus' default Kubernetes metrics. Go to the + button on the sidebar, and choose \"Dashboard\". To make a simple graph showing your queue size, you can write demo_queue_size in the query field. Click out of that input field and the graph should update. To see more, you can go back to Service Bus Explorer and send or receive messages. Your Grafana graph won't update immediately, but you should see results in a few minutes. In order to see results without manually refreshing, find the dropdown menu in the top right corner that sets the time range of the graph. Here you can edit time range and refresh rate. Make sure to save your new dashboard before exiting the page. Creating a Kubernetes dashboard \u00b6 Now we'll import a pre-created dashboard that shows Kubernetes metrics. There are multiple available on Grafana Lab's dashboard site - try 6417 . To import a dashboard, click the + button on the sidebar and choose \"Import.\" From there, you can either load a JSON file or enter the dashbord ID: 6417. Click \"Load\" and you will be given some configuration options. The only one that needs to be set is the Prometheus data source. From there, you should be able to create the dashboard and view metrics about your AKS cluster. Delete resources \u00b6 To delete all the resources used in this tutorial, run az group delete --name PromitorRG . \u2190 back","title":"Deploying Promitor, Prometheus, and Grafana on an AKS Cluster"},{"location":"walkthroughs/scrape-promitor-with-prometheus-on-azure-kubernetes-service/#deploying-promitor-prometheus-and-grafana-on-an-aks-cluster","text":"","title":"Deploying Promitor, Prometheus, and Grafana on an AKS Cluster"},{"location":"walkthroughs/scrape-promitor-with-prometheus-on-azure-kubernetes-service/#introduction","text":"In this walkthrough, we'll set up a basic monitoring solution with Promitor, Prometheus, and Grafana.

It can also be installed via the Azure CLI with az aks install-cli . Helm , a Kubernetes deployment manager. WSL , if you are using a Windows machine to deploy your whole solution. Deploying the Azure Infrastructure \u00b6 Preparing script \u00b6 Since we are going to use a lot of bash scripts with different variables values, it can be a good idea to parameterize everything. Let's start by exporting all the values we need: # SUBSCRIPTION_ID represents the Azure subscription id you will use to access your Azure resources export SUBSCRIPTION_ID = <subscription-id> # RG_NAME represents the resource group name where your cluster will be deployed export RG_NAME = PromitorWithManagedIdentityRG # LOCATION represents the Azure region where your cluster will be deployed export LOCATION = northeurope # CLUSTER_NAME represents the name of your Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster export CLUSTER_NAME = PromitorCluster # AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME represents the name of the Azure AD identity that will be assigned to Promitor. # Be careful, should be lower case alphanumeric characters, '-' or '.' export AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME = promitor-identity # As an example, we are going to use a service bus from where we want to grab some metrics, through Promitor # SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE represents the name of your Azure Service Bus namespace. # Be careful as Azure Service Bus Namespaces need to be globally unique. export SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE = PromitorUniqueNameServiceBus # SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE represents the name of you Azure Service Bus queue. export SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE = demo_queue Creating an Azure Resource Group \u00b6 First, let's create an Azure resource group in which we'll group all our resources: $ az group create --name $RG_NAME --location $LOCATION { \"id\" : \"/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>\" , \"location\" : \"<location-id>\" , \"managedBy\" : null, \"name\" : \"<resource-group-name>\" , \"properties\" : { \"provisioningState\" : \"Succeeded\" } , \"tags\" : null, \"type\" : \"Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups\" } Creating an Azure Service Bus Namespace & Queue \u00b6 First we'll need to create an Azure Service Bus namespace that provides metrics in Azure Monitor. These metrics will be scraped by Promitor and made available to the configured metric sinks. \ud83d\udca1 Consider this to be an example of metrics that you'd want to use in Prometheus, StatsD, ... Let's create the Azure Service Bus namespace: $ az servicebus namespace create \\ --resource-group $RG_NAME \\ --name $SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE \\ --location $LOCATION After that, we'll create a queue in that namespace: $ az servicebus queue create \\ --resource-group $RG_NAME \\ --namespace-name $SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE \\ --name $SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE Creating an Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster \u00b6 Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster that uses a system-assigned managed identity: $ az aks create --resource-group $RG_NAME \\ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \\ --generate-ssh-keys \\ --node-count 1 \\ --enable-managed-identity ... \"servicePrincipalProfile\" : { \"clientId\" : \"msi\" } ... Once created, the output will indicate that it is using managed identity. Setting up our cluster \u00b6 Getting The Cluster Credentials \u00b6 In order to interact with the cluster by using kubectl , we need to be able to authenticate to it. You can get the credentials for your Kubernetes cluster using this command: $ az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME Merged \"<cluster-name>\" as current context in /home/tom/.kube/config This saves the credentials in your kubeconfig file and uses it as your current context for all kubectl commands. Verify that you can connect and your cluster is up and running : $ kubectl get nodes NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-agentpool-34594731-vmss000000 Ready agent 15d v1.19.7 aks-agentpool-34594731-vmss000001 Ready agent 15d v1.19.7 aks-agentpool-34594731-vmss000002 Ready agent 15d v1.19.7 Get Azure Kubernetes Service managed identity & cluster resource group \u00b6 To be able to configure AAD Pod Identity component, we need information from our new Azure Kubernetes Service cluster: First, we need to get the name of the cluster resource group where the AKS internal resources have been deployed. echo \"Retrieving cluster resource group\" export aks_rg_name = $( az aks show -g $RG_NAME -n $CLUSTER_NAME --query nodeResourceGroup -otsv ) This is a generated resource group that typically uses MC_{resource-group}_{cluster-name}_{region} , for example MC_promitor-landscape_promitor_westeurope . Second, we need the identity of our cluster . This is the system-assigned identity of our cluster that is used to access Azure resources. echo \"Retrieving cluster identity ID, which will be used for role assignment\" export aks_mi_identity = \" $( az aks show -g ${ RG_NAME } -n ${ CLUSTER_NAME } --query identityProfile.kubeletidentity.clientId -otsv ) \" This identity is managed by Azure, since we have used the --enable-managed-identity option during cluster creation. Getting our cluster ready to use AAD Pod Identity \u00b6 Granting our cluster's managed identity required permissions in Azure \u00b6 In this walkthrough we are going to configure the managed identity for our cluster to allow AAD Pod Identity to access required resources in Azure. Learn more about the the required role assignments for AAD Pod Identity or have a general overview in the official documentation . In order to be able to use AAD Pod Identity, our cluster needs to be able to: Manage identities in our application & cluster resource group Manage the virtual machines that are part of the cluster, to use the assigned identity You can easily do this as following: echo \"Assigning 'Managed Identity Operator' role to ${ aks_mi_identity } on resource group ${ aks_rg_name } \" az role assignment create --role \"Managed Identity Operator\" --assignee \" ${ aks_mi_identity } \" --scope \"/subscriptions/ ${ SUBSCRIPTION_ID } /resourcegroups/ ${ aks_rg_name } \" echo \"Assigning 'Virtual Machine Contributor' role to ${ aks_mi_identity } on resource group ${ aks_rg_name } \" az role assignment create --role \"Virtual Machine Contributor\" --assignee \" ${ aks_mi_identity } \" --scope \"/subscriptions/ ${ SUBSCRIPTION_ID } /resourcegroups/ ${ aks_rg_name } \" echo \"Assigning 'Managed Identity Operator' role to ${ aks_mi_identity } on resource group ${ RG_NAME } \" az role assignment create --role \"Managed Identity Operator\" --assignee \" ${ aks_mi_identity } \" --scope \"/subscriptions/ ${ SUBSCRIPTION_ID } /resourcegroups/ ${ RG_NAME } \" Installing AAD Pod Identity \u00b6 To deploy AAD Pod Identity, we need to add the Helm chart repository: $ helm repo add aad-pod-identity https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/master/charts \"aad-pod-identity\" has been added to your repositories Update all your Helm repositories to use the latest and greatest: $ helm repo update Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories... ...Successfully got an update from the \"aad-pod-identity\" chart repository Update Complete. \u2388Happy Helming!\u2388 Lastly, install the Helm chart into your cluster: helm install aad-pod-identity aad-pod-identity/aad-pod-identity --set nmi.allowNetworkPluginKubenet = true Creating a user-assigned managed identity for Promitor \u00b6 In order to let Promitor to authenticate to Azure, we have two options: Re-ue the managed identity of our cluster, or (syste-assigned) Create a new identity that we will assign to our Promitor pods (user-assigned) In order to separate our concerns , we will create a new identity for it: echo \"Create identity $AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME in resource group $RG_NAME \" az identity create -g ${ RG_NAME } -n ${ AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME } Our new identity will be used by Promitor to access Azure Monitor to get metrics by using its assigned RBAC roles assignements : First, we will get the client & resource id of our identity: export AD_POD_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID = $( az identity show -g ${ RG_NAME } -n ${ AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME } --query \"clientId\" -o tsv ) export AD_POD_IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID = $( az identity show -g ${ RG_NAME } -n ${ AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME } --query \"id\" -o tsv ) Next, we will assign the Monitoring Reader role to our identity on our resource group to scrape our Azure Service Bus namespace: $ az role assignment create --role \"Monitoring Reader\" --scope \"/subscriptions/ $SUBSCRIPTION_ID /resourceGroups/ $RG_NAME \" --assignee \" ${ AD_POD_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID } \" { \"canDelegate\" : null, \"condition\" : null, \"conditionVersion\" : null, \"description\" : null, \"id\" : \"/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/92b1566a-2346-43f7-a093-1fd5871d4de8\" , \"name\" : \"92b1566a-2346-43f7-a093-1fd5871d4de8\" , \"principalId\" : \"<promitor-identity-id>\" , \"principalType\" : \"ServicePrincipal\" , \"resourceGroup\" : \"<resource-group-name>\" , \"roleDefinitionId\" : \"/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/43d0d8ad-25c7-4714-9337-8ba259a9fe05\" , \"scope\" : \"/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>\" , \"type\" : \"Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments\" } In order to verify our role assignement, you can use this command: az role assignment list --assignee $AD_POD_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID -g $RG_NAME | jq -r '.[].roleDefinitionName' \ud83d\udca1 It can take some times before the identity is correctly propagated in Azure Active Directory. So far if you encountered an error where the identity is not found, please wait 60 sec and retry Bind your Managed Identity to our Pods, through AAD Pod Identity \u00b6 Now that our identity is created, we can tell AAD Pod Identity that we want to bind our Azure AD identity to our pods: First, we will define the identity that we want to assign: cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: \"aadpodidentity.k8s.io/v1\" kind: AzureIdentity metadata: name: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME} spec: type: 0 # 0 - user assigned MSI, 1 - service principal resourceID: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID} clientID: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID} EOF Next, we want to define to what pods we want to link it: cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: \"aadpodidentity.k8s.io/v1\" kind: AzureIdentityBinding metadata: name: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME}-binding spec: azureIdentity: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME} selector: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME} EOF You can verify that the resources were created successfully as following: kubectl get azureidentity kubectl get azureidentitybinding Verifying the AAD Pod Identity installation \u00b6 Before going further, we will check if our AAD Pod Identity is deployed & configured correctly. We will spin up a pod and use the Azure CLI to authenticate: kubectl run azure-cli -it --image = mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli --labels = aadpodidbinding = $AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME /bin/bash Note that we are adding aadpodidbinding as a label, which is linking the pod to the AAD Pod Identity binding that we have just created. Warning: It can take some times to Aad Pod Identity to bind the identity to your deployed container. If you encountered an error, relaunch the az login -i --debug command after 60 sec. Next, we will run az login -i --debug to see the different steps it takes: # Once you are log in the container, and have the bash command line available, try to login using the Managed Identity: # If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter. $ bash-5.0# az login -i --debug msrestazure.azure_active_directory: MSI: Retrieving a token from http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token, with payload { 'resource' : 'https://management.core.windows.net/' , 'api-version' : '2018-02-01' } msrestazure.azure_active_directory: MSI: Token retrieved cli.azure.cli.core._profile: MSI: token was retrieved.
